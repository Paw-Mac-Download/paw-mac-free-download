## ❓ What is Paw for Mac?

**Paw for Mac** is a native macOS application tailored for API developers, testers, and backend engineers. It offers a sleek and intuitive interface to design, test, and debug REST, GraphQL, and other HTTP-based APIs. Unlike browser-based tools, Paw takes full advantage of macOS technologies to deliver smooth performance, advanced features, and tight system integration.

From crafting complex API requests to organizing reusable environments, Paw supports dynamic values, headers, cookies, authentication flows, and more. Its visual interface allows you to inspect server responses in structured formats such as JSON and XML, while the dynamic environments and request chaining allow for more advanced workflows.

Paw also supports extensions via JavaScript and export templates, enabling direct integration with your API documentation, client SDKs, or CI/CD pipelines. Whether you're testing endpoints, mocking services, or generating client code, Paw is a central hub for all API work on Mac.
